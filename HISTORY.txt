KitServer CHANGE LOG                                       February 11, 2016
============================================================================


Version 3.0.1
-------------
- fixed problems introduced in 3.0.0
  for: PES3 1.10.2, 1.30.1 and WE7 International


Version 3.0.0
-------------
- new features:
    * game speed regulator
    * aspect ratio (good for playing on widescreen monitors)
    * custom screen resolution


Version 2.0.5
-------------
- new feature: random ball selection.


Version 2.0.4
-------------
- A major bug fixed, when goalkeeping kits were not loading properly:
(loading into wrong team, not loading at all, etc.) Also the number/name 
colors for GK kits are now correctly set.
- That PES3 1.10.2 bug is fixed again. For sure. :-)


Version 2.0.3
-------------
- added a couple extra sample kits to KDB (for Dinamo Kiev)
- Unfortunately, the PES 1.10.2 bug that was fixed in v2.0.1 
was accidently introduced back in this release.


Version 2.0.1
-------------
This is bug-fixing (a.k.a. "maintanence") release.
The following bugs are fixed:

- In MATCH MODE, "P1 quick start" and "P2 quick start" modes were not handled
correctly. This resulted in weird effect of kits from different teams being
selected for players and goalkeepers, if more then one match was played in
either of these two modes.

- For PES3 1.10.2, players kits were always loaded into "1st strip", instead
of being loaded into currently selected strip. (This bug does not appear
if PES3 1.0, 1.30.1 and WE7I executable is used.)


Version 2.0
-----------
This is almost a complete re-write of the KitServer. It now has a different
architecture, where you have to install it as a plug-in for the game, unlike 
in earlier (1.x) versions when you had to keep the kserv.exe running together
with the game so that it could hook on it.

The new architecture has several advantages:

1. Requires less resources, because no windows hooking is needed.
2. The game itself loads KitServer on startup, and unloads on exit, so no 
need for manual start of kserv.exe (in fact, there is no kserv.exe anymore)
3. Compatibility mode problems, which i believe were caused by the need
to do run-time hooking, should be resolved now.

The following features are also new in this release:

- Ball selection (You can select from any number of balls from KDB)
- Goalkeeper kit selection (KDB now contains goalkeeper kits as well)
- Text labels for all selectable items for easy identification. (For
example, some teams use the "European" kits, which look identical from the
front, but are different at the back. Text label identifies exactly which
kit file is currently in use.)
