505e94: man utd collars: 1st-pl, 2nd-pl, 1st-gk, 2nd-gk.
(0 - have collar, 2 - no collar)

Collars formula:
0x5058a4 + N*20  (where N is team number)

Colors formula:
0x506db8 + N*104 (where N is team number)

One exception to formulas:
When Master League Team is picked to play against Club or National team,
then N becomes B3(home) or B4(away) for master league, and therefore
the formula cannot be applied. 
It works fine in the Master League Mode however, which is much more
important.

NOTE: 
At runtime, all addresses are + 400000 (pes3.exe module load address).
So for example, 506db8 becomes 906db8.

STATE:
- hot keys are now only available during Strip Selection screen.
- quick jamming of hot keys is safe now.
- ML vs Club/National is properly handled. (Disabled for ML team)
- bug-fix: when user cancels after strip selection but before match
starts. Now colors and collars are correct.

TODO:
- more intuitive uniform cycling [100% done]
- implement full database support (as opposed to hardcoded) [100% done]
*****
- UI work / Config work
- strip out extraneous code (taksi parts)
- change hard-coded PES addresses to relative ones (from .text, .data, etc.)


Known issues:
bad (corrupt, improper formated) uniform files will crash the game, when
attempt is made to load them.
